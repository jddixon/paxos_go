paxos_go/TODO

    * Link to online documenation in README.md must *NOT* appear in
        ghpDoc/index.md

    * Need to specify a protocol for commands sent to the server;
        the protocol in p.proto is suitable only for communications
        between the servers in a cluster.

    * Need a test which spawns a cluster of N servers, runs say K
        keep-alives, then shuts down with Bye/Ack.  The low-level
        code must make available the attributes of cluster members
        (ID, listening address (ipv4+port), sigPubKey, commsPubKey,
        isLive, a boolean.  We also expose quorate, a boolean which
        is true if a majority of cluster members are live.

    * edit gocheck_test.go, recently stolen from xlReg_u, to a form
        more appropriate for testing paxos_go

    * review makeACluster -- it would seem to generate nodes where
        we have no knowledge of their private keys, and so which are
        of limited value
