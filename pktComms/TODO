    * revise keep_alive_test to follow xlReg_go/eph_server_test.go
        as model
        - this means scrapping or revising functions in misc_test.go
        - 

2014-09-11
    * Fix references to hash in p_test.go, which should actually refer
        to the SHA3-256-based digital signature
    * Fix the test itself, which should fail because it's a hash rather
        than the expected digSig

2014-09-05
    * revise to use tcpIP rather than UDP for comms

2014-09-04
    * fix 'flag redefined' error in gocheck                             * DONE
