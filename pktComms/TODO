    * PktLayer.Run() morphs into HelloToPeers

2014-09-16
    * FIX panic in helloGoodBye_test.go                                 * DONE
    * pktLayer.JoinCluster() should signal on pktLayer.DoneCh when      * DONE
        done, sending pktLayer.DoneCh <- err                            * DONE
        - hmmm, that's unsafe; make DoneCh a chan(error)                * YEP
    * pktLayer.HelloToPeers() handled like JoinCluster
    * pktLayer.KeepAlives() 
    * pktLayer.Switch()
    * pktLayer.SendByes()

    * helloGoodbye_test.go spins up K nodes; each says hello to its
        K-1 peers, pause, then send Bye to peers and shuts down
        - all functionality in misc_test.go, called using one-liners
    * when helloGoodbye_test.go runs OK, modify keepAlive_test.go
        to use the same approach; so it just adds another one-liner

2014-09-12
    * revise keep_alive_test to follow xlReg_go/eph_server_test.go
        as model
        - this means scrapping or revising functions in misc_test.go

2014-09-11
    * Fix references to hash in p_test.go, which should actually refer
        to the SHA3-256-based digital signature
    * Fix the test itself, which should fail because it's a hash rather
        than the expected digSig

2014-09-05                                                              * DROP
    * revise to use tcpIP rather than UDP for comms                     * DROP

2014-09-04
    * fix 'flag redefined' error in gocheck                             * DONE
