# paxos_go

A library enabling the achievement of consensus within a cluster of 
XLattice nodes (independent computational units with unique cryptographic identities).  Intra-cluster communications pass over a full mesh of inter-node
connections.  Clients can query the cluster or propose new commands which 
will pass through the consensus process and upon agreement will become part
of the cluster's state.
